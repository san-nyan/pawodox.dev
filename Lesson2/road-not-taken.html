				<p>Two roads diverged in a <mark>yellow</mark> wood,<br>
				And sorry I could not travel both<br>
				And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
				And looked down one as far as I could<br>
				To where it bent in the <sub>undergrowth;</sub></p>
			</section>	
			<section>
				<p>Then took the other, <sup>just as fair,</sup><br>
				And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
				Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
				Though as for that the passing there<br>
				Had worn them really about the same,</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
				In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
				Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
				Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
				I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
				Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
				Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
				I took the one less traveled by,<br>
				And that has made all the difference.</p>
